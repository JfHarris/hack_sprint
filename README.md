#Spring Events to make your Garden Blossom

This project is a website to show events and resources for spring cleaning and gardening.

## Motivation

This project is a hack sprint for Holberton School Tulsa.

We were provided with a prompt of "Blossom".

Our idea was to create a minmal viable product that would serve as a clearinghouse for events and resources

to help with spring cleaning, gardening, and other ways to help a home and garden blossom in the spring.

## Build Status

The project is usable from a local host, but not yet hosted and published on the web

## Tech

We have coded the site primarily in HTML and CSS with information from the google calendar API to integrate a calendar of events.

## Usage

Fork and Clone the repo to your local machine and then run by going to the local host address http://127.0.0.1:5500/[your path here]

## Issues

We have not automated the addition of events to the calendar or the scraping of events for our right hand side.  This is considered a stretch goal for the project at this time
